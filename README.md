# UWW COMPSCI 424 Program 1 in Python

## Your notes for me

*If you have notes or messages for me, please put them here so I can see them.*

## About this repository and autograding

Use this template for Operating Systems Program 1 in Python. 

To run correctly, your main file **must** be named `p1main.py`. You can use additional Python files, but make sure to import them into p1main.py. No specific project structure is needed.

The GitHub Classroom autograder will use the command `python3 p1main.py` to run your code. Write only Python 3 code. Python 2 code is deprecated and is not guaranteed to work.

This Python template repository does not include a virtual environment. You are welcome to add any virtual environment that you like and push it to your own repository. If you just want to keep it simple and run plain Python code, that's fine too.

If you are encountering problems getting your code to pass tests when you push to GitHub Classroom, please [email me](osterz@uww.edu) with a description of what's happening. I will look at your repository on GitHub to try to help you debug.

## Advice for Python programmers

This advice is also posted on the Program 1 page on Canvas. Updates, if any, will be posted there.

* Your program can use separate functions for each version (e.g., `def v1` and `def v2`), then use the main program (outside of all functions) to run the tests and evaluate running times for both versions. You may define additional functions as needed. If you prefer to use another structure, that's fine too.

* Any Python 3 version will work. If you develop on washington.uww.edu or another Linux system, make sure your program runs with the `python3` command.

* Consider using the [`process_time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html?highlight=time#time.process_time) or [`process_time_ns`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html?highlight=time#time.process_time_ns) functions to get detailed timing data for your program. To enable these functions, add `import time` at the start of your Python file.

* You can use standard Python lists to implement your linked lists. The standard [Python mutable sequence operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable) should give you similar functionality to a linked list.
